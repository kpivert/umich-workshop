This repository contains the materials for [three tidycensus workshops given at the University of Michigan in March 2021](http://www.ssdan.net/webinars-march-4-11-25-accessing-and-analyzing-census-data-using-r).

To use these materials, clone the repository to your computer:

or download and unzip in a directory of your choosing.  

You'll also need to obtain a Census API key at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html and activate it from your email account.  Have the key ready for the workshop.
